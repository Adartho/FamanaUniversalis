It is also common for these associations to indulge in mystic traditions, and often unorthodox adaption of the Romal's teachings. Something that sometimes makes it hard for the laws of the clergy to penetrate the urban milieu. An artisan in [fraternity_province.GetName] has reached out to the state, warning us of a local guildsman with a great influence on local affairs.

#Aresian Decadence Events
 aresian_decree_active:0 "Aresian Decree Active"
 aresian_dec.0.t:0 "A Spectre Looms Over Aresia"
 aresian_dec.0.d:0 "Aresia is not what it once was. The realm lays in ruins and the people do not seem to care much for worshipping Phamsa. Corruption, heresy and general depravity run rampant. There is no doubt that our lord is dissapointed, and that Aresian civilization is in decline. Our golden age is over."
 aresian_dec.0.a:0 "These are dark times."

 aresian_dec.1.t:0 "Excessive Tithes"
 aresian_dec.1.d:0 "The Aresian church is demanding increasingly outrageous tithes from our peasants. Of course, pleasing Phamsa is paramount, but only to a point. The level of religious taxation is becoming crippling for many peasant farmers, and perhaps now it is time for the state to step in."
 aresian_dec.1.a:0 "Phamsa deserves it all."
 aresian_dec.1.b:0 "Put an end to this!"

 aresian_dec.2.t:0 "Nepotism in Government"
 aresian_dec.2.d:0 "Our statesmen are simply put incompetent. Ours is a system where jobs are inherited and not earned. While this may be politically convenient, it is disastrous for the functioning of our nation. Our advisors have proposed that we institute a system of examination to find our new bureaucrats. However, this reform would also require us to purge our state of people unfit for their jobs."
 aresian_dec.2.a:0 "Preposterous!"
 aresian_dec.2.b:0 "Just what we needed."

 aresian_dec.3.t:0 "Scandal in the Court"
 aresian_dec.3.d:0 "Recently, facts have surfaced that paint the court of [Root.GetName] in a bad light. It is said that members of the ruling [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty have siphoned tax money to send to relatives outside of the country. The lower nobility is getting uppity at this news, so we best address it soon."
 aresian_dec.3.a:0 "Punish the wrongdoers."
 aresian_dec.3.b:0 "Cover it up."

 aresian_dec.4.t:0 "Crumbling Roads"
 aresian_dec.4.d:0 "The road network of [Root.GetName] is in a sorry state. Our infrastructure is crumbling and it is making it harder and harder for travellers to get around. We ought to renovate them before the problem gets too bad. But, it would be expensive."
 aresian_dec.4.a:0 "No price is too great."
 aresian_dec.4.b:0 "We cannot afford this!"

 aresian_dec.5.t:0 "Dwindling Authority"
 aresian_dec.5.d:0 "Our outer cities seem to be growing more distant from [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]. The $MONARCHTITLE$'s authority is being undermined, which can under no circumstances be tolerated. We must bring our nation together, or it will be the end of [Root.GetName] as we know it."
 aresian_dec.5.a:0 "Show them who's in charge."

 vanoma.1.desc:0 "Upset with the increased government presence on their isle of Emtit, the pirates who call the island home have jointly decided to abandon it. These marauding buccaneers have long plagued the waters of the Aresian Gulf, hijacking the region's trade and causing mayhem as far south as the shores of Bamal. Now, at long last, they appear to be leaving. Where to is not certain, but rumors say they are sailing for Irfa, an uninhabited island to the east of Emtik. We can do nothing but hope that they never return."
