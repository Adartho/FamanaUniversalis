 nafan_gov_desc:0 "The Nafan government is ruled by an emperor, always named Syadon. In an attempt to make their ruler appear immortal, Nafa would switch out the ruler and heir upon the emperor's death, and make them take the name Syadon. The emperor was rarely seen in public, and physical depictions of him did not exist."
