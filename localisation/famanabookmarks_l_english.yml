 FAMANA_GOMIC_BOOKMARK:0 "Fall of Moxon"
 FAMANA_GOMIC_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Once the world's greatest power, the Empire of Moxon was very shortlived. Its Yomtanian armies ravaged the Gomic, but they all mutinied after they found out about an ancient temple, and learnt of a second continent across the ocean filled with more of their kind. The temple was set alight by the King of Maky, in an attempt to kill the Yomtanian menace. The enraged Yomtanians then proceeded to destroy the country, leaving only weak local tribes formed from survivors in their place.\nWith the empires of old having fallen, foreign invasions looming, and new empires such as Ordica on the rise, the story of the region is still being vividly written out."

However, there are still many independent kingdoms operating around the sea, and the remnants of the old Kingdom of Qanoyo in Avus fled to Tomba, where they claim to be its direct successors."
