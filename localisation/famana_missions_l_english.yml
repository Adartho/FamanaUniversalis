 #Kinvireli Missions
 kin_theory_of_helvania_title:0 "Theory of Helvania"
 kin_theory_of_helvania_desc:0 "The Theory of Helvania was invented centuries ago in Ancient Vaximor. After the collapse of the Oppian Empire, the merchants of Kinvirel founded the Republic of Kinvirel based on the democratic ideals of Helvania. It is vital that we preserve these values and do not succumb to autocracy like the rest of Jasua."
 kin_stabilize_the_realm_title:0 "Stabilize the Realm"
 kin_stabilize_the_realm_desc:0 "Now that we have solidified the founding ideology of our republic, we need to stabilize the situation in the capital. Many competing factions seek to seize power in Kinvirel, which we cannot allow."
 kin_the_grand_helvania_title:0 "The Grand Helvania"
 kin_the_grand_helvania_desc:0 "Our republic is the greatest in all Famana! Monarchs all around the Gomic hate us, simply because we are so successful. With our growing state apparatus, we will be just as strong as our autocratic rivals."
 kin_the_lathvy_question_title:0 "The Lathvy Question"
 kin_the_lathvy_question_desc:0 "The question of the Lathvy faith has plagued Kinvirel for years. Many in the country choose follow this new religion, especially in the northern cities. While the faith is completely tolerated in Kinvirel and sometimes mixes with local pagan worship, we ought to make up our mind. Should we adopt this religion, or hold on to our old beliefs?"
 kin_the_one_true_faith_title:0 "The One True Faith"
 kin_the_one_true_faith_desc:0 "Our state has finally chosen to adopt a single religion. But the religious problems of Kinvirel are far from over, as many in the country are not fully commited to their faith. To secure religious unity in Kinvirel, we must practice it to its fullest extent."
 kin_jasuan_religious_unity_title:0 "Jasuan Religious Unity"
 kin_jasuan_religious_unity_desc:0 "Jasua has long been divided along religious lines. In the south, Oppians practiced their own faith. In the north, many converted to the pagan Bamali religion. In Kapolia, Lathvy reigned supreme. This religious division is no more! Our ruler has seen to it that every Jasuan worships the same gods."
 kin_end_the_dark_age_title:0 "End the Dark Age"
 kin_end_the_dark_age_desc:0 "For far too long, Jasua has been mired in poverty and division. Ever since the Oppio-Jasuan War, the cities and roads of Jasua, once the greatest in the world, have been neglected and are now in a truly deplorable state. The Dark Age of Jasua has gone on for long enough. We are now in a position to finally reunite Jasua under one state, bringing an end to the current state of affairs so that we may rebuild and reclaim our status as a Gomic great power."
 kin_expel_mahansha_title:0 "Expel Mahansha"
 kin_expel_mahansha_desc:0 "Mahansha is a pest for the entire Eastern Gomic. Their ships raid and pillage the coasts of Jasua and beyond indiscriminately. This cannot be allowed to continue, so Mahansha must be driven out of Jasua."
 kin_defeat_zoblotra_title:0 "Defeat Zoblotra"
 kin_defeat_zoblotra_desc:0 "Our conquest of Mahansha has shown that our army is capable of fighting back against the Oppians. With this in mind, it would seem foolish not to attack the weak Zoblotrans to our south."
 kin_establish_coffee_monopoly_title:0 "Gomic Coffee Monopoly"
 kin_establish_coffee_monopoly_desc:0 "Coffee has never been an important export of Kinvirel. Spices and paper have always overshadowed our small coffee plantations. But now that we have conquered parts of the Hoxoi Coast, it is becoming clear that we are in control of the entire Gomic's supply of these precious beans. Perhaps this should be taken advantage of."
 kin_pacify_bamal_title:0 "Pacify Bamal"
 kin_pacify_bamal_desc:0 "The Bamali people, once an ally of ours, have been integrated into our realm. We must secure our hold on the region before we expand further northward."

 kin_reforging_the_jasuan_empire_desc:0 "The time has come to restore the mighty Jasuan Empire. The new empire, having regained the former glory of the old, will soon come to overshadow its predecessor. As we expand along the shores of the Gomic, we will spread the noble ideals of Jasua. The new golden age of Jasua is upon us."
 kin_hinder_yabonia_title:0 "Hinder Yabonia"
 kin_hinder_yabonia_desc:0 "To our east lumbers the giant Kingdom of Yabonia. Stronger than our puny republic, yet severely overstretched, Yabonia may be difficult to defeat. But with a strong army and the help of allies, we may just be able to."
 kin_onward_to_Jimkalin_title:0 "Onward to Jimkalin"
 kin_onward_to_Jimkalin_desc:0 "Our victorious conquest of western Yabonia has greatly weakened our rival and brought us closer to their capital. With these new territories in hand, we have a real claim to the entirety of the Jasuan heartland."
 kin_destruction_of_yabonia_title:0 "Neutralize Yabonia"
 kin_destruction_of_yabonia_desc:0 "Yabonia will soon be all but destroyed. We have conquered most of their land, and what remains of their pathetic kingdom will soon be wiped out by our grand army. We are now the rulers of the Jasuan heartland, so it is time to take the rest of our rightful territory."
 kin_unification_with_kapolia_title:0 "Unification with Kapolia"
 kin_unification_with_kapolia_desc:0 "Kapolia. The final piece of Jasua, yet unclaimed by our rising republic. Whether through diplomacy or war, we will integrate it into our state."
 kin_pearl_of_jasua_title:0 "Pearl of Jasua"
 kin_pearl_of_jasua_desc:0 "Kinvirel, our capital and most important city, is the greatest city in Jasua and the historic capital. But if we expanded the city even more, Kinvirel could truly be a jewel of the eastern Gomic."
 kin_sponsor_the_merchants_title:0 "Sponsor the Merchants"
 kin_sponsor_the_merchants_desc:0 "Many of our merchants are struggling to compete with Maxan and Xalnish traders. To secure our hold on the eastern Gomic trade network, we should do everything we could to make their job as easy as possible."
 kin_eastern_gomic_trade_title:0 "Eastern Gomic Trade"
 kin_eastern_gomic_trade_desc:0 "As the major trading power in the eastern Gomic, we are making a lot of money. However, to truly dominate the trade routes, we need a large merchant fleet."
 kin_assert_control_of_hartimatul_title:0 "Assert Control of Hartimatul"
 kin_assert_control_of_hartimatul_desc:0 "Harmanul, our old trading colony, has always been very important. It is a vital outpost for our merchants, but one thing has always been preventing us from using it as a staging ground for invading the Maxan isles, that being the local Maxan population. To take full advantage of Hartimatul, we must expel the locals and re-settle it with Jasuans."
